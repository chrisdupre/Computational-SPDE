Simple Reporstory for me to keep track of my work on a computational methods for SPDE book. 

Ch.1 
  - Still to do: 1.13, 1.23 b., 1.23 c.
  - Need to implement code in examples for shared functions. 

Ch.2 
  - Include Pictures for 2.5
  - Possible mistake in 2.9 Implementation, need to check
  - Still to do 2.11, 2.19-2.23
  - Use already implemented functions in 2.12 and 2.13
